-This RMD script is part of a collaboration with Dr. Cristina Howard-Varona's research from Ohio State University (2019-2020) 

-Direct Inject FTICR-MS (negative mode) data generated at University of Arizona (PI Malak Tfaily) was ran through Formularity (Tolic et al. 2017) for formula assignments. The masses from each sample were also ran through Cytoscape with MetaNetter 2.0 plugin.

-The report file from formularity and network analysis file from Cytoscape were then used to do all downstream analysis within this script (Gibbs Free Energy, Class Compound etc)
